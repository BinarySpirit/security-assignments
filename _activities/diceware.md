title: Diceware Activity
description: An exercise creating passphrases using the EFF's long improved-usability list.
---

For this activity, you will create passwords using wordlists. Passwords made of words are called passphrases. This approach was introduced in 1995 as the [Diceware system](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html).
The original wordlist had 7,776 words total. A single word is chosen from the list by rolling five 6-sided dice (6^5 = 7,776).

But the original list had "usability" problems -- some of the words were hard to remember, or were not valid dictionary words, etc.
So the EFF [created a set of more usable lists](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases). For this activity, use the [EFF's 
"long" improved-usability list](https://www.eff.org/files/2016/07/18/eff_large_wordlist.txt), which also has 7,7776 words, albeit more usable words.

## Questions

1. What are the two six-worded passphrases that you created?

1. What is the amount of entropy in bits for your six-word Diceware passphrases? Show your work.

1. How long in years do you calculate it would take to guess a six-word Diceware passphrase if you could try 100,000,000 passwords a second? Show your work.

1. How much longer would it take to guess a seven-word Diceware passphrase?

1. Explain what Diceware has to do with Kerckhoff’s principle and Shannon’s maxim (e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle)).

1. How usable/memorable do you think Diceware passphrases are?
